<center><h1>OOP In Dart</h1></center>

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming method that uses objects and their interactions to design and program applications. It is one of the most popular programming paradigms and is used in many programming languages, such as Dart, Java, C++, Python, etc.

In OOP, an object can be anything, such as a person, a bank account, a car, or a house. Each object has its attributes (or properties) and behavior (or methods). For example, a person object may have the attributes name, age and height, and the behavior walk and talk.
